## ItemJoin (Get custom items on join)
-----

### Description
-----
```
ItemJoin is a feature-packed custom items plugin allowing you and your players to get custom items upon performing 
certain triggers such as on join, world-switch, respawn, region-enter, region-leave and more. ItemJoin is very 
versitile allowing you to only enable features as you need them as most features are not shown by default you will 
need to add them to the items.yml as they are needed. These features can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/RockinChaos/ItemJoin/wiki) and the config.yml has all additional features disabled by default. 
The goal of this plugin is to provide a seamless transition from any previous custom items plugin and to give you 
the power to add features as you want them so that you do not have any unnessesary features cluttering your 
configurations. The number of features that ItemJoin supporst is limitless however some features include 
item commands, join commands, custom enchantments, custom map images, player heads, and a fully in-game GUI creator.

### Installation
```
1) Once the ItemJoin.jar is downloaded, the jar must be placed into your servers plugins folder.
2.) Double check the servers plugins folder for any duplicate ItemJoin.jar files, such as ItemJoin(1).jar, delete the duplicate instances.
3) Once this is completed, the server must be restarted in order to register and enable the plugin. The plugin
   will then attempt to find your server version and generate a configuration based on the found version.
4) From this point, the fate of the plugin lies in your hands!
